**I am currently working on my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?) Capstone Project to build on the extensive Data Analytics experience from my last job at GoDaddy and hopefully make Data a bigger part of my career going forward. This page is part of the portfolio I'm putting together as a part of the Capstone Project. This will give me a way to show what I'm able to do with Data since everything I did at GoDaddy is behind their firewall.**

## Work Experience

**Technical Writer Manager, GoDaddy Inc. Kirkland WA** 2021 - 2024
- Managed a global team of 5-7 writers responsible for producing over 50% of GoDaddy's support content, resulting in consistent year-over-year improvement in content performance, >93% of customers not contacting Support after viewing the content and a Glint Manager Effectiveness score of 96.  
- Drove the adoption of data-driven decision-making across the team, resulting in the second highest organizational Tableau usage across GoDaddy and every writer improving the performance of their content year-over-year. 
- Increased revenue using revenue data for customers who viewed our content and either made purchases online or when they contacted Support. The data was used to decrease friction to purchase for customers with specific issues and increased monthly revenue by 10X.  
- Developed processes using FullStory for real-time customer experience tracking, identifying product/content issues within 24 hours, and providing actionable insights. It played a critical role in evaluating the impact of GoDaddyâ€™s first AI product launch.
